1. set an environment variable: "machine=in02" (or in01).
This will specify which machine you are gonna launch these benchmarks with this configuration.

2. Copy the template to your favored location. Change the name to e.g."config1". 
Go into this folder and use command:"sh setup_ALL.sh $config1".

Ask me if there's any problem. Thanks!
